# Simulator

A discrete event simulator made for simulating protocols in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs).
Other protocols can be implemented to run in the simulator using the `Node` interface, however currently only the Starling protocol has been implemented.

## Usage

For the help menu:

```sh
go run ./example 
```

To run a simple example: 

```sh
go run ./example -e simple
```
